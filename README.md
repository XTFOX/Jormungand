## Jormungand
This is a work in progress I will update the texture mod as I confirm the exact spawn locations of the Frost Wurms in game.

[Jormungand](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jormungand) is one of the rarest bosses in Guild Wars and the [unique hammer](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Jormungand%27s_Thunder) he drops is extremely difficult to farm. This texture mod adds his possible spawn locations to the Mission Map [U] in game making him much easier to find.

### Requirements:
1. Enter Bjora Marches from Jaga Moraine. The spawns may not be consistent if you come from any other zone.

### Notes:
Morythe Bly put together extensive notes on the spawn locations of Jormungand in Bjora Marches and this would not have been possible without their work. You can see the map they put together below.
1. Every time you enter Bjora Marches you have three potential chances to find Jormungand. One in the North West (Orange), one in the South West (Green), and one in the South East (Blue)
2. If you find a Frozen Elemental or a Frost Wurm in a region (Orange, Green, Blue) it guarantees that Jormungand has not spawned there and you can move on to the next region.
3. The text mod notes the exact position in game where I have seen a Frost Wurm spawn. I have seen the wurms spawn slightly off from where the markers are however they have always been in compass range when standing on a marker.
